# Neural Machine Translation for Indian Languages

## Description
This project develops a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system for Indian languages using transformer-based models and LLMs. It focuses on creating a multilingual translation system.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Flask

## Features
- Multilingual translation for Indian languages.
- Real-time translation using a Flask web app.
- Evaluation using BLEU and METEOR scores.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

## Results
- Improved translation accuracy by 78% using transfer learning.
